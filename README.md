# TODO

- Think if I should migrate from local storage to cookies
- Change example photos for user uploads so it makes more sense
- Don't upload user images, since we only need the zip file
- Ask for 12 photos minimum, and convert most other image formats to png or jpg
- Prompt engineering
- Curate style selections for each gender
- Pay for sentry
